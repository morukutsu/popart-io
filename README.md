## I/O Modular Video Synthesizer
popart-io is a project inspired by hardware video synthesis.

Using basic waveforms (sin, square, tri or saw) and advanced modulation, it is possible to combine different effects to create unique video sequences.

Each build block has a set of parameters which can be tweaked to reveal new shapes and patterns.
See patchs folder for examples...
